For each possible move (in legal boards only):

1. WIN THE LOCAL BOARD
   - If AI ("O") has two in a row and can win this board:
     → Make the winning move.
     → Unless this sends player to a dangerous board, then 50% chance to do it anyway.

2. AVOID PLAYER ADVANTAGE
   - Check if the move sends the player to a board where they can win (2-in-a-row).
     → If yes, skip this move (mark it as risky).
     → If no, add it to safe_moves.

3. BLOCK THE PLAYER'S THREAT
   - If the player has two in a row in a board:
     → Block the third cell if it doesn't send AI into danger.
     → Prefer blocks that don’t send to a risky board.

4. SET TRAPS
   - Choose a move that sends the player to:
     - A won board,
     - A full board,
     - A harmless board (no player 2-in-a-rows).

5. PRIORITIZE BIG BOARD VICTORY
   - Among safe or trap moves, prefer ones that:
     - Win you big-board alignment (horizontal, vertical, diagonal).
     - E.g., Completing top row in boards 0, 1, 2.

6. FALLBACK
   - If no safe or smart move:
     → Pick a risky move randomly.
     → Sort by big board value if possible.
